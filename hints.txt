I use docker-compose:

docker-compose can be used to start multiple containers, and not many services in one 
container

we have postgres, node, redis

to remember: 
docker-compose top

!!
to access another container from one container is the NAME of the container 
(see routes/index.js)


### ### ### ### ###

# old: before 4.11.2022

connecting to db:

attach to the running container with

docker exec -it 7f9b5a44f1e8 /bin/bash

719... is  the container ID


then use psql

to find the value of the autoincrementer:

SELECT currval(pg_get_serial_sequence('fruits', 'id'));


ok, instead of 'fruits' and 'id' you have to use the correct column names

what i set up for the urlshortener


\psql

create table shorties ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, uri VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL );

you can insert values by ommiting the id itself by using

insert into shorties(uri) values ( 'www.heise.de' );

\q


(ok, i have to verify the last statements, i just typed them down from memory)





voila
